    MITRE mitigation: [M1016](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1016/), [M1045](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1045/)


Placing gates in the container registry to prevent pushing or quarantine images that does not meet the content trust requirement. Some container registries can support gates that will prevent pushing images, while others might quarantine images after they were already push to the registry. Ensuring that gates exsits at the registry level can help preventing bypass of gates at the CI/CD pipelines level.
