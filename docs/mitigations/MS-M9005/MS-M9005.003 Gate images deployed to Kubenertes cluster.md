    MITRE mitigation: [M1016](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1016/), [M1045](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1045/)


Gate deployment of images to Kubernetes cluster to prevent deploying images that does not meet the content trust requirements. This can include limiting images to be deployed only from trusted registries, to have digital signature or pass vulnerability scanning and other checks. This can prevent potential adversaries from using their own malicious images in the cluster. Also, this ensures that only images that passed the security compliance policies of the organization are deployed in the cluster. Kuberenetes admission controller mechanism is one of the commonly used tools for implementing such policy.
