    MITRE mitigation: [M1022](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022/)


When using `hostPath` volumes, set it to “read-only” mode if possible. This prevents the container from writing to files in the underlying node and will harden an escape from the container to the node.

Kubelet monitors a specific folder on the node which contains static pods manifest. By default the location of static pod manifest on nodes is at `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`. Restrict access of users to this folder to avoid deployments of unwanted static pods.
