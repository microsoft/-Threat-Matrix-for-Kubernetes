    MITRE mitigation: [M1018](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1018/)


Configure the Kubernetes role-based access controls (RBAC) for each user and service accounts to have only necessary permissions. This applies also to other, external, authorization providers such as Azure RBAC in AKS.

In managed cluster, Kubernetes credentials are often retrieved or generated by the cloud provider via API call. To reduce the attack surface, grant permissions to the cloud provider API only to necessary accounts. In the case of Azure, make sure that only required identities have permissions to call: `/subscriptions/resourceGroups/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterUserCredential`

Kubeconfig file can contain credentials of accounts that allow interaction with a cluster. By applying least privileges principle to all accounts, can limit the impact of an account compromised through Kubeconfig file.

Kubernetes project also lists the following recommendations for permissions and role assignment best practices:

 * Avoid wildcard permissions, especially to all resources.
 * Use RoleBinding instead of ClusterAdminBinding to give access within a namespace.
 * Avoid adding users to the system:master group as it bypasses RBAC.
 * Use impersonation rights for admins instead of adding to the cluster admin role. Audit and monitor when impersonation is being done.
 * Avoid granting the escalate or bind permissions to roles when not needed, audit and monitor when escalation is being made.
 * Avoid adding users to the system:unauthenticated group.
 * Limit permissions to [issue CSR and certificate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/rbac-good-practices/#csrs-and-certificate-issuing).
 * Avoid granting users with `create` rights on `serviceaccounts/token`, which could be exploited to create TokenRequests and issue tokens for existing service accounts.
 * Users with control over `validatingwebhookconfigurations` or `mutatingwebhookconfigurations` can control webhooks that can read any object admitted to the cluster, and in the case of mutating webhooks, also mutate admitted objects
