# Allocate specific identities to pods

!!! info inline end
    ID: MS-M9019<br>
    MITRE mitigation: -


When needed, allocate dedicated cloud identity per pod with minimal permissions, instead of inheriting the nodeâ€™s cloud identity. This prevents other pods from accessing cloud identities that are not necessary for their operation. The features that implement this separation are: Azure AD Pod Identity (AKS), Azure AD Workload identity (AKS), IRSA (EKS) and GCP Workload Identity (GCP).
