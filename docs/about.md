# About

The purpose of the threat matrix for Kubernetes is to conceptualize the known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) that adversaries may use against Kubernetes environments. Inspired from MITRE ATT&CK, the threat matrix for Kubernetes is designed to give quick insight into a potential TTP that an adversary may be using in their attack campaign. The threat matrix for Kubernetes contains also mitigations specific to Kubernetes environments and attack techniques.
